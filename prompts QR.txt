secuencia de QR 




so that when a teacher uploads media (pictures, videos, audio) for a specific student like Adrian or Jacob in the Teacher Portal, the generated QR code will link to a dedicated page that displays all media content for that particular student. This will create individual student portfolios accessible via QR codes, with each student having their own unique collection of uploaded media that parents can view by scanning the code.
